as I could."

That mostly involved following tutorials, and reading through documentation.

### What specifically have I done this week?

I followed various tutorials on Node.js, and express.js (a web framework for Node) on
[treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/). I set up a development environment in vagrant
with Ubuntu 14.04, Node.js, and express.js. I followed several tutorials on using
WebRTC with socket.io, setting up rooms in socket.io, etc.

### What have I learnt this week?

Node.js is an environment for running JavaScript on the server, and is built on Chrome's 
V8 engine. Node uses a non-blocking, asynchronous architecture, so the process doesn't have to
wait on file IO, or database operations. WebSockets allow you to open a persistent connection 
between the client and the server which alows each to send data to the other without reestablishing 
the connection. WebRTC automatically handles video encoding, user sessions, etc, but you still
need a signaling server for passing messages, as well as a STUN server, and in some situations, 
a TURN server.

### What would I do differently if I could have the time again?

I would start earlier.
