I haven't made as much progress at this point as I probably should have. I didn't write
blog posts in the first few weeks, so now I'm playing catch-up, and trying to remember 
what I did in those weeks. I still haven't started building a prototype, so that's
something I'll need to do next week.

### What have I done this week?

I wrote my project outline, and submitted it to turnitin. I started writing blog posts
for the last couple of weeks, and am hosting it on github pages using the static site
generator, Jekyll. I continued reading through 'Learning WebRTC' by Dan Ristic. I kept
reading through journal articles.

### What have I learnt this week?

I learned more about WebRTC. I learned about Selective Forwarding Units (SFUs), and Multi-point
Control Units (MCUs). I learned how to set up a blog with Jekyll (kind of unrelated, but still
interesting, I think).

### What would I do differently if I could have the time again?

I would start earlier. I would spend more time on my project.
