description: "This week I made a very simple prototype of a video calling application."

It's based on an example from 'Learning WebRTC' by Dan Ristic. It's much simpler than the
final application I want to make, which will allow for multi-party video conferences. It's
also a little bit buggy. The prototype is hosted on [heroku](https://shielded-beyond-99553.herokuapp.com/).
On the first page you enter a user name, and click on the log in button. On the second page,
you can scroll down for a list of other people signed in. Since WebRTC is still a working draft,
the site won't work in older web browsers, internet explorer, or safari.

### What have I done this week?

This week, I made a little protoype of the final application. I kept reading through tutorials, and
documentation. I continued reading through 'Learning WebRTC' by Dan Ristic.

### What have I learnt this week?

I've learnt how to develop a website with node.js, express, and socket.io. I learned how to deploy a
node application to heroku. I learned how to create a basic signaling server with WebSockets. I learned
how to establish a p2p connection using the RTCPeerConnection API. I learned how to access the web cam
and microphone using the getUserMedia function.

### What would I do differently if I could have the time again?

I would start earlier. I would spend more time on my project.
