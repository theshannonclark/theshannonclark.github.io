I was curious about WebRTC, which is a technology that allows you transmit video and data
between two web browsers without using a server as an intermediary. The most obvious use
cases for this technology are video streaming, and video conferencing. There have also been 
more interesting uses of the technology, such as: [WebTorrent](https://webtorrent.io/), which 
allows you to torrent files in a web browser; [FilePizza](https://file.pizza/) and 
[ShareDrop](https://www.sharedrop.io/), which allow you to transfer files; and 
[Codassium](http://http://codassium.com/), which is a collaborative browser-based code editor
with video conferencing, and a terminal emulator for code execution.

The project I decided to work on is a multi-party peer-to-peer video conferencing website for
students to create study groups, and collaborate with each other online.

### What specifically have I done this week?

After choosing a project, I started reading about how WebRTC works. I started looking for journal
articles on P2P video streaming, and conferencing. I determined that I would need to learn about
Node.js, and socket.io, and started following tutorials on those topics.

### What have I learnt this week?

I learned about Node.js, as well as npm (node package manager), and WebSockets.

### What would I do differently if I could have the time again?

I would start earlier.
