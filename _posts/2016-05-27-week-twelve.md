The application is basically finished at this point, albeit simpler than I had intended.

### What have I done this week?

This week, I expanded the application to support multiple users with a mesh topology. It isn't as efficient as other topologies, but it is simpler to set up, and it works fine for the small number of users I had intended to support. I added a chat feature using WebRTC's data channel, and a file sharing component. I also wrote the final report.

### What have I learnt this week?

I've learnt how to use WebRTC's data channel.

### What would I do differently if I could have the time again?

I would start earlier. I would spend more time on my project.
