The client of the application will be implemented as a single-page application using AngularJS.

### What have I done this week?

This week, I followed the AngularJS tutorials on team treehouse, and read through the angular documentation. I continued reading through 'Learning WebRTC' by Dan Ristic.

### What have I learnt this week?

I've learned how to develop a simple client-side application with AngularJS. I've learned about AngularJS directives, controllers, and services. I've learned how to use $routeProvider to set up client-side routes.

### What would I do differently if I could have the time again?

I would start earlier. I would spend more time on my project.
