I didn't get much finished this week.

### What have I done this week?

I read through various tutorials on WebRTC, and AngularJS. I read through a tutorial on how to use socket.io with AngularJS.

### What have I learnt this week?

I've learnt how to create a service in AngularJS for setting up socket event listeners.

### What would I do differently if I could have the time again?

I would start earlier. I would spend more time on my project.
