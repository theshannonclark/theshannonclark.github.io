### What have I done this week?

I read through various journal articles on WebRTC, P2P video streaming, and P2P
video conferencing. I started reading 'Learning WebRTC' by Dan Ristic.

### What have I learnt this week?

In a P2P video conferencing application, a mesh topology isn't very efficient for a 
large number of participants. DTLS and SRTP are used WebRTC to encrypt data.

### What would I do differently if I could have the time again?

I would start earlier. I would spend more time on my project.
