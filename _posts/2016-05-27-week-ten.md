Another unproductive week.

### What have I done this week?

I split up my pages into partial .ejs files, and set up a route on the server to serve these files. Then I configured the $routeProvider to use these templates in the view.

### What have I learnt this week?

Not much.

### What would I do differently if I could have the time again?

I would start earlier. I would spend more time on my project.
