Every step in the peer connection process needs to be carried out in order. The prototype didn't prevent the client from doing things out of order. There were no checks in the prototype to prevent someone from sending an answer to another user before receiving an offer, for instance.

### What have I done this week?

This week, I fixed a few bugs.

### What have I learnt this week?

Not much.

### What would I do differently if I could have the time again?

I would start earlier. I would spend more time on my project.
